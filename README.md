# realyz

Pronounced 'realize', the goal of this project is to connect people to people. Recruiting can be more than algorithms screening text files, and we hope to make it so.

Based on Node.js, Express and React.

## Running

Prerequisites:
- The backend uses Node.js, so install it from their website
- For the server layer, this project uses MariaDB (which must also be installed)

Setting up the database:
This section is a WIP and will be updated at a later time.

Then, one should clone this repository into a directory of their choice. In that directory, follow these steps:
- Enter the project directory with `cd realyz/backend`
- Install relevant packages with `npm install`
- Start the server with `npm start`

There is a .env configuration file that contains some information that is required in order to use the backend.
For security reasons, this is not published. There is, however, a "fill in the blank" version of this file called `env.template`.
